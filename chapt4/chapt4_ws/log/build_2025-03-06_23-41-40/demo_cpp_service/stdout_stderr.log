[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findchatp4_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "chatp4_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "chatp4_interfaces"
  with any of the following names:

    chatp4_interfacesConfig.cmake
    chatp4_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "chatp4_interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "chatp4_interfaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "chatp4_interfaces" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
